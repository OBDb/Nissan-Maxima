Powered by a 3.0L V6 producing 160 horsepower (190 hp in SE trim), it was available with a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission.

This generation introduced a more upscale interior with improved materials, available navigation system, and expanded safety features including side airbags.

Powered by a 3.5L V6 (VQ35DE) producing 265 horsepower, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT) or 6-speed manual. This generation faced challenges in distinguishing itself from the increasingly powerful and refined Altima, leading to a stronger emphasis on luxury features including available SkyView fixed glass roof panels, heated steering wheel, and premium audio. The SkyView roof and unusual interior styling with a 'wave' dashboard represented attempts to differentiate the model through distinctive design elements."
